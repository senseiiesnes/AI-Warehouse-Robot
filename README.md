## Overview

This repository contains a Python solution for a warehouse robot using Q-learning. The robot is trained to navigate and optimize its path within a warehouse environment to efficiently collect and deliver items.

## Features

- Q-learning algorithm for autonomous robot navigation.
- Warehouse environment simulator.
- Optimized path planning for item collection and delivery.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Additional Python libraries
  - [simpleguics2pygame](https://pypi.org/project/simpleguics2pygame/)
  - [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/senseiiesnes/AI-Warehouse-Robot.git
   ```
   
2. Install Dependencies

    ```bash
    pip install numpy SimpleGUICS2Pygame
    ```

3. Run the main.py script

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to start and configure the simulation.

5. Watch as the robot learns and optimizes its path over time.

6. Analyze and visualize the results.
